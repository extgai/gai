text = '''A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter
bound together by gravity.
The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the
Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System.
Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars, range in size from dwarfs with less than
a thousand stars, to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion
stars, each orbiting its galaxy's centre of mass.
Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few per cent of
that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae.
Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies..'''
